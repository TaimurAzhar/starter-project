#### 1. Exploration Not Helpful

Writing a good exploration requires having a goal in mind. Do not start creating an exploration without a plan. Once you have done the planning done you might want to check out a few other similiar works online that have the same goal as you. Looking at examples is always a big help. :grinning:

With great planning you will have a much clearer idea of what your exploration should be look like as well as what it should contain.


#### 2. Exploration Too Long

Explorations can have many _sub-goals_ but the main one is always to transfer some learning to the explorer. However, in doing so we get carried away sometimes and end with too much content inside a single exploration. It is also possible that your cards are too long and the learner has lost their attention.

After you have your entir exploration listing as small individual tasks and headings then you have a clearer picture of the flow. Use the headings to understand how you can possibly seperate your content into different explorations. 
>Knowing just the right length for an exploration takes time and experience. Don't give up!



#### 3. Exploration Too Hard

It is possible to make an exploration that is not well suited for your target audience in terms of difficulty. When this happens it's generall a good idea to take a step back and once again break things down in to smaller chunks. You mainly want to focus on breaking down your tasks into more cards and not have learners do too much too fast. 



## 2. Understanding and using Card Statistics

### **High Number of Quits on a Card**
   - [Card is too long](#_1-card-is-too-long)
   - [Card is too hard](#_2-card-is-too-hard)

#### 1. Card is too long

The card may fail to keep the attention of the reader for so long so it would be a good idea to break the card down into multiple sequential cards so that there is some form of engaging interaction between reading material.


#### 2. Card is too hard

The difficulty of this card might be too high so users might be getting frustrated and leave. Try changing the content inside the card to better explain the message you are trying to get across. 


### **Card Entered too less**
   - [Card does not play a part in the story](#_1-card-does-not-play-a-part-in-the-story)

#### 1. Card does not play a part in the story

If the Card is not significant to the story or to teach any lesson then it may not be visited as much as you expect. As the card has no real significance then he path leading up to the card may not be intrigueing enough to try out. It is suggested to remove the card or change the card. For Exmaple: 
If the card is a card that comes after a wrong answer submission but the answer was too obvious to begin with. Then this card will never be visited as it is redundant. In this case the problem can be resolved by rmoving the card. However, in some cases you may not wish to remove the less visited card. In this case you should focus on the path that leads up to this card and try to make the questions harder.
